## Overview

The main goal of this project is to create and develop a thorough database for bookstores that caters to both physical and online retailers. Our bookstore database is designed to mimic a real world bookstore interface, where the consumers, employees, and managers might have different perspectives of the same database system. Our implementation is broken into 4 sections:
- Customer
- Inventory
- Employee
- Management

## How to Run:

#### Setting up the Databse

- In MySQL Workbench, upload and run the `sql_scripts/create_db.sql` file to create the database.
- Before adding any other records to the newly created database, run the `sql_scripts/insert_statements.sql` file in MySQL Workbench to add the initial sample records to every entity.

#### Using the GUI

- In a terminal open to the project directory, run the following command to interact with the GUI: `python src/gui.py`
- Enter your MySQL credentials when prompted.
- To interact with all the features, refer to the project report.
